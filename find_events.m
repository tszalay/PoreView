function DNAevent = find_events(cf)
%FIND_EVENTS Finds events and returns an array of DNAevent structs
%   events = find_events(cf)
%   This is just an example of how to use CrampFit programmatically.

    % Alternatively, instead of passing a CrampFit instance to the code,
    % you could just initialize one here:
    % cf = CrampFit(filename);
    % and then add any virtual signals you need, set up the panels, and
    % then start finding events on your merry way...

    DNAevent = [];

    thresh = 0.07;
    
    % use the signal specified in the second panel of CrampFit for the
    % event finding. you'd probably just hardcode this in your own code.
    sig = cf.psigs(2).sigs;

    % loop through entire file, a bit at a time
    curind = 0;
    
    while 1
        % find next data exceeding threshold, stepping current index
        curind = cf.data.findNext(@(d) d(:,sig) > thresh, curind);
        
        % if we didn't find any, we're done with the file
        if curind < 0
            break

        imin = curind;
        % find the end of the event
        imax = cf.data.findNext(@(d) d(:,sig) < 0.75*thresh,curind);
        
        % make sure we have an end for the event
        if imax < 0
            break

        % event? maybe event?
        ts = cf.data.si*[imin imax];
